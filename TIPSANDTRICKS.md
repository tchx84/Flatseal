# Tips and Tricks

## Manually reset Flatseal permissions

If permissions are removed and is no longer possible to reset, run the following command from the terminal and re-start Flatseal:

```
$ rm ~/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal
```

## Translations

Add a new language and update translations:

```
$ echo "es" >> po/LINGUAS
$ ninja flatseal-pot
$ ninja flatseal-update-po
```

To test the translation language:

```
$ flatpak config --set extra-languages es
$ flatpak update org.gnome.Platform
$ LC_ALL=es_PY.UTF-8 flatpak run com.github.tchx84.Flatseal
```

## Enable custom installations

To enable a custom installation, e.g, `/xusr/custom/flatpak`.

### Flatpak 1.7.1 or newer:

1. Launch Flatseal and select it to edit its own permissions.
2. Enable `host-etc`, or type in `host-etc:ro` in the other option.
3. Type in the custom installation path, e.g, `/xusr/custom/flatpak:ro`.
4. Restart Flatseal.

### All versions

1. Launch Flatseal and select it to edit its own permissions.
2. Enable `host`, or type in `host:ro` in the other option.
3. Restart Flatseal.

**NOTE**: To find these installations, Flatseal needs access to `/etc/flatpak/installations.d`. Before Flatpak 1.7.1, accessing the host `/etc` required the `host` permission, which was an all-or-nothing situation. By default, Flatseal will have minimal permissions, so it's up to the user to decide to enable this feature.
